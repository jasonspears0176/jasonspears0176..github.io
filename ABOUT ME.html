	<p>Hi! My name is Melina and welcome to my portfolio! A little bit about me, I'm a mother, wife, and a Jane of all trades when it comes to anything pertaining to the art world! I have always had a passion for the arts, it didn't matter what medium. I dabble in a little bit of everything from traditional sketching and painting to the digital arts, graphic design, customizing clothes and shoes, crafting and even tattooing! I'm a firm believer that art has no limits and is constantly evolving. Whether it be through painting, drawing, literacy, music, dance, cooking, decorating, crafting, designing, makeup, hair, fashion, etc., we were all created to create!    </p>
